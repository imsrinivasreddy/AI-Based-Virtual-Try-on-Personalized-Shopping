# AI-Based-Virtual-Try-on-Personalized-Shopping
Project Overview
This project presents an AI-powered Virtual Try-On System that allows users to visualize how garments fit on their body using a combination of 2D image processing and 3D hybrid modeling.

The system integrates computer vision, deep learning, and 3D rendering techniques to generate realistic try-on outputs from a single image.

Key Features
Virtual garment try-on using user image 3D human body reconstruction (SMPL model) AI-based pose estimation (OpenPose) Texture mapping & cloth alignment Real-time rendering using WebGL (Three.js) Hybrid pipeline (2D warping + 3D modeling) Scalable backend using FastAPI
Tech Stack
